# Voltage

Voltage, also known as electric potential difference, is the force that pushes electric current through a circuit. It's like the pressure that pushes water through a pipe.

Voltage is measured in volts (symbol: V), named after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta who invented the voltaic pile, the first chemical battery.

In a direct current (DC) circuit, such as a battery powering a device, the voltage pushes the electric current consistently in one direction. The battery has a positive terminal (+) and a negative terminal (-), and the voltage pushes the current from the positive to the negative terminal.

In an alternating current (AC) circuit, such as the power from a wall outlet, the voltage causes the current to switch directions (or "alternate") regularly.

Voltage, current, and resistance are related to each other by Ohm's law, which states that the current (I) through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage (V) across the two points, and inversely proportional to the resistance (R) between them. This relationship is usually written as V = I x R.
